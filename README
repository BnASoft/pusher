This is a demo repository for sending messages to users.
Currently its just simple one message to another. We can enhance this
to trigger notifications in the server itself

There are 3 pre-registered users:
gautam@example.com / abcd123
sethu@example.com / abcd123
admin@example.com / abcd123

When you login via any of these, you can send messages to the other 
users from a simple form
